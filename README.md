This project is designed to help you understand and work with ES6 Promises in JavaScript. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the concepts of Promises, how to use methods like `then`, `resolve`, `catch`, `every`, and more. You will also learn about error handling using `throw` and `try`, the `await` operator, and how to create and use async functions.
