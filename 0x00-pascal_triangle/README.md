# Pascal's Triangle

This Python project generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows and returns it as a list of lists. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical pattern that starts with a 1 at the top, and each subsequent row is generated by summing up the two numbers directly above it.

## Usage

To generate Pascal's Triangle, use the `pascal_triangle(n)` function, where `n` is the number of rows you want in the triangle.

```python
from pascal_triangle import pascal_triangle

# Example: Generate Pascal's Triangle with 5 rows
triangle = pascal_triangle(5)
print(triangle)
